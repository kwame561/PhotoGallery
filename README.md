This project was bootstrapped with the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) command-line interface, leverages [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) on the backend and hosted on the [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) cloud platform.

The project is a photo gallery where users can add photos via URLs as well as remove pictures. Feel free to access the app [here](https://panorama-shots.herokuapp.com/).
